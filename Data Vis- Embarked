Embarked

Background and insights 

There were three embarking stations (S,C,Q) recorded in this feature. 
There were two data points missing from this feature, using the most common embarking port(S) these points were replaced.
A factor plot was used to compare the surviral rate between the three embarking ports. 
Port C had the highest precentage of surviral of the three. Bargraphs were used to compare various combinations of embarking ports and survival.


    1. The first graph displays the amount of people in each catergory. Port S was the most common boarding station with over 600 passangers. 
            Followed by port C with roughly 150 and port Q which has less than 100 people board.
    2. The next graph depict the amount of people that survived(1) or passed away(0) per port.
    3. The final graph displays the likelihood to survive per port. 
        Individuals that embarked at C port had a 50% chance of survival compared to Q, 
        which is just shy of 40% and S with a roughly 30% chance of survival.
