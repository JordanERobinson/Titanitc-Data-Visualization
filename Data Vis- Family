Family

Background and insights

In this section the features Parch and Sibsp were explored. I was curious to see if traveling with family or alone effected survival and how. 
I began by combing Parch and Sibsp into one column that I named Family. 
Groups that were greater than 1 were catergorized as Family, less were catergorized as alone.


    1. The first graph displays the average amount of families vs solo passengers. 
      It shows that between the two there were more individuals then there were familes.
    2. The second graph displays the average survival of families vs solo passengers. 
      It shows that those tho traveled in families or groups were more likely to survive. 
      Passengers that traveled alone had about a 30% survival rate compared to those who traveled in groups/families just above 50% survival rate.
